How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It make it easy to find the difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Less waste of time looking for differences

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros would be the possibility of knowing the last "working" version, as on the other hand we wouldn't know which was exactly the last point; a con would be the possibilit of losing some changes if we forget to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Its a better way to know the files involved in some changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Reading the logs we can find information about the changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We would have a previous working version to return to in case of breaking something up

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To learn to have a better control of the development process
