When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It would allow a better way to collaborate, and also, the possibility of having access to the latest content from the internet

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because that way we have more control of the local changes
