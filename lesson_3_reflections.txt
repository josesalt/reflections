When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It would allow a better way to collaborate, and also, the possibility of having access to the latest content from the internet

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks apply only in the GitHub environment, clones to local-GitHub environment or local-local environment, and branches are used in both locations

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The possibility of working off-line with the last known state 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Making notes to what changes I' doing and trying to understand the changes made by others; it could create a big file with a lot of comments, and it could make it difficult to follow


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
The changes must be done in a different branch in order to preserver the master of unwanted changes. 
The benefit of changing directly the master could be that it is faster, but on the other hand, it could get out of control, something that using branches is avoided
